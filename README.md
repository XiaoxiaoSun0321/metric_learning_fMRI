# Functional Neuroimaging with Deep Metric Learning

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

We propose a metric learning framework to extract meaningful latent structures from high-dimensional fMRI data. This method learns the latent embeddings that reduce the intra-group variability while maximizing the inter-group variability. More details can be found here (new manuscript is in preparation): https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9871492
